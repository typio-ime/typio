# Entity: Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

Intent: record a durable architectural decision and its historical context for the lifetime of the project.

---

## 1. Non-Negotiable Invariants

- **`[INV-ARCH-01]` Immutability**: Once an ADR is marked `Accepted`, its decision outcome, rationale, and invariants are permanently immutable. To modify a prior decision, author a new ADR that explicitly supersedes or amends the prior record.
- **`[INV-ARCH-02]` Negative Knowledge**: Every ADR must explicitly record rejected alternatives and why they failed to prevent future human contributors and AI assistants from attempting discarded approaches.
- **`[INV-ARCH-06]` Significance Threshold**: Trivial implementation details, localized function refactorings, or temporary workarounds must never be recorded in `docs/adr/`. An ADR must satisfy the 3-Question Significance Test.
- **`[INV-TEMP-03]` No Direct Deletion**: Never delete an accepted ADR. Stale records transition to `Superseded`, `Deprecated`, or `Compacted` and move to `docs/adr/archive/`.

---

## 2. Admission Filter: What Qualifies as an ADR (The 3-Question Test)

To prevent **ADR Inflation** and keep the architecture log high-signal, a proposal must satisfy **at least two** of the following three criteria:

```text
       ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
       │ 1. High Reversal Cost?                                      │
       │ Would reversing this decision require multi-week refactoring│
       │ or breaking downstream migrations?                          │
       └──────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                                      │
       ┌──────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┐
       │ 2. Cross-Boundary Blast Radius?                             │
       │ Does it alter subsystem boundaries, public API protocols,   │
       │ storage layouts, or non-functional SLAs (latency, security)?│
       └──────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                                      │
       ┌──────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┐
       │ 3. Generates Binding Invariants?                            │
       │ Does it establish hard behavioral red-lines that human devs │
       │ and AI coding assistants must unconditionally obey?         │
       └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

If a decision does not meet this threshold, **do not write an ADR**. Route it to a Pull Request description, a code comment, or an issue thread.

---

## 3. Anti-Patterns: Bad ADRs to Reject

Maintainers and AI review gates must reject proposals exhibiting these anti-patterns:

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Correct Alternative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Triviality Smear** | Authoring ADRs for routine choices (e.g., choosing a JSON serializer or renaming an internal module). | Document rationale in the Git commit message or PR description. |
| **The Ephemeral Workaround** | Recording temporary bug fixes, transient feature flags, or environment hacks. | Use inline code comments (`// TODO: ...`) and tracking issues. |
| **The Toothless Declaration** | An ADR written as vague prose without explicit, testable `Invariants & Behavioral Boundaries`. | Reject or revise to extract enforceable constraints. |
| **The Post-Hoc Justification** | Writing an ADR after code is already merged with zero genuine consideration of alternatives. | Reject. If no real options existed, it was an implementation detail, not a decision. |
| **The Style Guide Masquerade** | Recording formatting rules, naming conventions, or lint preferences. | Add to linter configuration or `spec/core/style.md`. |

## 4. ADR Lifecycle State Machine

```text
       [ Proposed ] ───► [ Accepted ] ───► [ Deprecated ]
             │                  │
             │                  ├───► [ Superseded by NNNN ]
             │                  │
             │                  └───► [ Compacted into Snapshot ]
             ▼
       [ Rejected ]
```

- **Proposed**: Open for stakeholder review and feedback.
- **Accepted**: Ratified and binding on the repository.
- **Rejected**: Evaluated but not adopted. Retained permanently for negative-knowledge audit.
- **Deprecated**: Functionality removed without replacement.
- **Superseded**: Formally replaced by a subsequent accepted ADR (`NNNN`).
- **Compacted**: Incorporated into a living architecture document (`docs/architecture/<subsystem>.md`) and relocated to `docs/adr/archive/`.

## 5. Directory Setup & Registry

Create `docs/adr/` with an index before recording decisions:
- `docs/adr/index.md` — The registry table of all active decisions.
- `docs/adr/archive/` — Cold storage directory holding retired decisions.
- `docs/adr/NNNN-<slug>.md` — Individual records numbered as zero-padded integers (e.g., `0001-modular-governance.md`).

### Registry Index Pattern (`docs/adr/index.md`)

To allow human engineers and AI coding assistants to quickly locate architectural decisions and assess constraints without loading complete ADR files into context, `docs/adr/index.md` must provide a concise decision summary and primary invariant for every entry.

```markdown
# Architecture Decision Records

| ID | Title | Status | Scope | Decision Summary & Primary Invariant | Date | Living Snapshot |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [0001](0001-setup.md) | Modular Architecture | Accepted | core | Adopt hexagonal architecture with decoupled adapter layers | 2026-01-10 | - |
| [0002](archive/0002-wal.md) | In-Memory WAL | Compacted | storage | Shared-memory append log with backpressure ring buffers | 2026-02-15 | [`docs/architecture/storage.md`](../architecture/storage.md) |
```

#### Index Summary Guidelines
- **Conciseness**: Keep each summary to 1–2 factual sentences (around 20–50 words).
- **Substantive Outcome**: State the chosen option, key trade-off, or binding invariant; avoid meaningless tautologies (e.g., avoid "Defines architecture").
- **Fast AI Routing**: The summary serves as an authoritative filter so agents can determine whether an ADR applies before fetching the full text.

## 6. Authoritative ADR Template

```markdown
# NNNN. [Title of Decision]

- Status: Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded by [NNNN](NNNN-slug.md) | Compacted into [Snapshot](../../architecture/<subsystem>.md)
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Scope: [e.g., core/network, storage/wal, cli]
- Deciders: [Names / GitHub handles]
- Consulted: [Names / GitHub handles]
- Informed: [Names / GitHub handles]
- Related RFC: [Link to RFC or deliberation thread, if applicable]

## Context and Problem Statement

Describe the context and problem statement in a few sentences. What problem are we solving, and why does it matter now?

## Decision Drivers

- Driver 1: e.g., Modularity, performance, maintainability
- Driver 2: e.g., Backward compatibility with existing ecosystem

## Considered Options

- Option 1: Title of option 1
- Option 2: Title of option 2
- Option 3: Title of option 3

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[Option 1]", because [detailed justification].

### Invariants & Behavioral Boundaries

List the non-negotiable architectural rules resulting from this decision:
- Invariant 1: Mandatory behavioral constraint for human contributors and AI coding assistants.
- Invariant 2: Permitted or prohibited cross-boundary dependencies.

### Positive Consequences

- Positive consequence 1
- Positive consequence 2

### Negative Consequences & Trade-offs

- Negative consequence 1 (trade-off)
- Mitigation strategy

## Rejected Alternatives & Negative Knowledge

Detail why alternative options were discarded:

### Option 2 (Rejected)
- Why considered: [e.g., Lower initial implementation cost]
- Why rejected: [e.g., Introduced unbounded memory growth under backpressure]

### Option 3 (Rejected)
- Why considered: [e.g., Simpler concurrency model]
- Why rejected: [e.g., Incompatible with required latency SLA]
